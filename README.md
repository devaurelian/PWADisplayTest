# PWA Display Test
See how Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) look and feel on your devices and platforms. Try it on Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, and other operating systems. Test if the standalone display mode really opens the PWA to look and feel like a standalone native application. Test if a fullscreen PWA really takes up the entirety of your screen. Try all the web app manifest display modes: fullscreen, standalone, minimal-ui and browser. To install PWA Display Test, just click on the Add to Home Screen button in supported browsers.
